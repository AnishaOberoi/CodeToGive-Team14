# CodeToGive-Team14

LET US HELP YOU
The aim of this project is to address the current situation of various additions among youth.
The code is a web app hosted on [http://34.133.16.76:8080/](http://34.133.16.76:8080/) and we can scan the QR code to directly open the website.
We used HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap for the frontend and NodeJS leveraging Express Framework and MongoDB for the backend.
This is the basic workflow of our website.
The flow of the code starts from index.js which handles all the get and post requests.
All the web pages are ejs files in the views folder.
Public folder contains all the css and js files.
Schema for our database is stored in models folder.
