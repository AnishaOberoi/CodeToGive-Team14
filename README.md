# CodeToGive-Team14

LET US HELP YOU <br />
The aim of this project is to address the current situation of various additions among youth.<br />
The code is a web app hosted on [http://34.133.16.76:8080/](http://34.133.16.76:8080/) and we can scan the QR code to directly open the website.<br />
We used HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap for the frontend and NodeJS leveraging Express Framework and MongoDB for the backend.<br />
This is the basic workflow of our website.<br />
The flow of the code starts from index.js which handles all the get and post requests.<br />
All the web pages are ejs files in the views folder.<br />
Public folder contains all the css and js files.<br />
Schema for our database is stored in models folder.<br />
